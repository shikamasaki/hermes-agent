"""Secret-free, on-disk cache of provider account usage for delegation routing.

Route selection must be cheap and non-blocking: an orchestrator that fans out
twenty tasks cannot pay a quota HTTP round trip per task, and it must never
stall a delegation behind a provider control plane that is slow or down.  So
selection reads *only* this cache, and refreshes happen out of band.

Freshness contract (thresholds come from ``delegation.routing``):

* ``age <= usage_ttl_seconds`` → **fresh**; used as-is, no refresh.
* ``usage_ttl_seconds < age <= usage_stale_seconds`` → **stale**; the reading
  is still used (a 10-minute-old quota is far better than no signal) and one
  background refresh is scheduled for that provider.
* older, missing, or unavailable → **unknown**; the selector applies the
  configured ``unknown_usage`` policy and one refresh is scheduled.

**What is persisted.** Only a normalized projection: provider slug, fetch
timestamp, source label, and per-window label / used / remaining percent /
reset timestamp.  Never a token, API key, account or profile identity, project
id, request header, credential path, raw error text, or raw provider response
body.  Those fields exist on the snapshot objects this module consumes (a
window ``detail`` can quote an account email; ``unavailable_reason`` can quote
a URL with a query-string key), so the projection is an explicit allowlist
rather than a redaction pass — a new upstream field cannot leak by default.
The file is written atomically at mode 0600 under the active HERMES_HOME.
